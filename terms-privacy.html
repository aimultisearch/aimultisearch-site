      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        AI Multi Search (“the App”, “the Service”, “we”, “our”, “us”) lets you
        compare answers from multiple AI models (such as ChatGPT, Gemini,
        Claude, and others) in a single search. These Terms of Use and Privacy
        Policy (“Terms & Privacy”) apply to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the AI Multi Search mobile app (Android and, later, iOS); and</li>
        <li>the website at <strong>https://aimultisearch.com</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By using the App or visiting the website, you agree to these Terms &
        Privacy. If you do not agree, please do not use AI Multi Search.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>

      <h3>2.1. On the Website (aimultisearch.com)</h3>
      <p>
        The website is mainly a landing page and waitlist. We collect the
        following data:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Waitlist email address</strong> – If you enter your email in
          the “Notify me at launch” form, your email is sent to a private
          Google Sheet controlled by LM Tech Studio.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics data</strong> – We use Google Analytics (GA4) to
          understand how many visitors use the website, which pages are viewed,
          basic device information, and approximate location (country/city).
          This data is aggregated and does not let us identify you personally.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2. In the Mobile App</h3>
      <p>
        AI Multi Search is designed with privacy-first principles. By default:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Search history and preferences</strong> are stored
          <strong>locally on your device</strong> (for example, recent prompts
          or which layout you prefer). You can usually clear or reset this
          data inside the app’s settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>No account is required</strong> to use the app. We do not ask
          you to log in or provide your name.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>App usage data</strong> may be collected in anonymous form by
          the app stores (for example, crash reports or install statistics),
          according to Google Play / App Store policies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.3. AI Requests Sent to Third-Party APIs</h3>
      <p>
        When you type a question in AI Multi Search, your text needs to be sent
        to external AI providers (for example, OpenAI for ChatGPT, Google for
        Gemini, Anthropic for Claude, etc.) to generate an answer. This means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your prompts and the generated answers may be processed and stored by
          those providers, according to their own terms and privacy policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not use your prompts to build our own user profiles or to
          target advertising.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please review the privacy policies of the AI providers you choose to
        use in the App (e.g. OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.), as they may keep
        logs of requests to improve their services, prevent abuse, and maintain
        security.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          To send you a <strong>one-time email</strong> when the app launches
          (if you joined the waitlist).
        </li>
        <li>To operate and improve the App and website.</li>
        <li>
          To understand anonymous usage trends (for example, number of visits,
          popular devices) via Google Analytics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data and we do
        <strong>not</strong> use it to show ads inside AI Multi Search.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Legal Bases (for EEA / UK users)</h2>
      <p>When required by law, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent</strong> – for collecting your email for the waitlist
          and for using cookies/analytics where consent is required.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legitimate interest</strong> – for basic, privacy-friendly
          analytics and for securing and improving the Service.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Data Sharing & Third Parties</h2>
      <p>We may share data with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI providers</strong> (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.) to
          generate answers to your prompts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Google</strong> for analytics and error reporting, through
          services such as Google Analytics, Google Play services, or similar.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service providers</strong> who help us operate the Service
          (for example, email or hosting providers), under confidentiality
          obligations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authorities</strong> if required by law, or to protect our
          rights or the safety of users.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We do not sell or rent your data to data brokers or ad networks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Waitlist emails</strong> are kept until the launch email has
          been sent or until you request deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Local data on your device</strong> (history, settings) is
          kept until you clear it from the app or uninstall the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics data</strong> is retained according to the default
          retention settings of Google Analytics (which may change over time).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
      <p>
        Depending on your location, you may have rights over your personal data
        (for example: access, correction, deletion, restriction, objection, or
        data portability).
      </p>
